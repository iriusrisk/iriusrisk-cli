# CI/CD Drift Detection Feature

**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Target:** v0.4.0  
**Purpose:** Design document for AI-powered security drift detection in CI/CD pipelines

**Implementation Approach:** Version-based comparison using IriusRisk project versions

## Problem Statement

Customers need AI-powered verification in CI/CD pipelines to detect when code being deployed diverges from approved security baselines. Engineering teams make architectural changes (adding components, modifying dataflows) without security review, and these changes aren't caught until much later.

### Key Pain Points
- Developers add unapproved components (Redis, external APIs, new services)
- Security-relevant architectural changes go unnoticed
- Security reviews happen too late in the process
- No automated visibility into drift from approved state

## Solution Approach

**Core Concept:** Visibility, not enforcement

Provide AI agents with the ability to:
1. Compare current codebase against an approved baseline (using IriusRisk versions)
2. Surface architectural changes (components, dataflows, trust zones) AND security changes (threats, countermeasures)
3. Generate human-readable reports for manual review
4. Post findings to PRs/tickets for security team review

**Key Technical Approach:**
- Leverage IriusRisk project versions for baseline management
- Download baseline from IriusRisk version for comparison
- Compare architecture (diagram XML) AND security (threats/countermeasures JSON)
- Isolated verification workspace (`.iriusrisk/verification/`) for safe operations

**NOT in scope for MVP:**
- Automated approval/rejection decisions
- Policy rule engines
- Enforcement gates
- Approved component lists

## High-Level Workflow

### One-Time Setup
1. Security team reviews and approves initial threat model in IriusRisk
2. Create version snapshot in IriusRisk (e.g., "v2.1-approved" or "baseline-2024-01-12")
3. Configure CI/CD to reference the approved baseline version
4. Configure CI/CD to run AI verification on PRs/deployments

### Per-Deployment Workflow
1. **CI/CD triggers** → AI agent activates
2. **Download baseline** → Fetch approved version from IriusRisk to `.iriusrisk/verification/baseline-*` files
   - baseline-diagram.xml (architecture)
   - baseline-threats.json (threats)
   - baseline-countermeasures.json (countermeasures)
3. **AI generates OTM** → Analyzes current codebase state
4. **Import to IriusRisk** → Update project with new OTM, wait for threat computation
5. **Download current state** → Save to `.iriusrisk/verification/verification-*` files
   - verification-diagram.xml (architecture)
   - verification-threats.json (computed threats)
   - verification-countermeasures.json (computed countermeasures)
6. **Compare architecture** → Identify component, dataflow, trust zone changes
7. **Compare security** → Identify threat and countermeasure changes
8. **AI interprets** → Assesses security implications of changes
9. **Generate report** → Human-readable findings with full context
10. **Restore baseline** → Revert IriusRisk project to baseline version
11. **Cleanup** → Remove all `.iriusrisk/verification/` files (baseline-* and verification-*)
12. **Post results** → PR comment, Slack, ticket, etc.
13. **Human review** → Security team decides if acceptable

**Note:** Both baseline and verification files are temporary working storage, created and deleted during each verification run.

### What AI Reports

**Architectural Changes:**
- Components added/removed/modified (type, trust zone, purpose)
- Dataflows added/removed/modified (source, destination, data types)
- Trust zone changes (components moved, new zones)

**Security Changes:**
- Threats added/removed/modified (severity, affected components)
- Countermeasures added/removed/modified (status, effectiveness)
- Risk level changes

**Context and Assessment:**
- Security impact assessment for each change
- Relationship between architectural and security changes
- Recommendations for security review

### Human Decision Points
- Is the new component acceptable?
- Are the architectural changes appropriate?
- Do new threats have adequate mitigations?
- Does this require architecture review?

## Technical Components

### Version-Based Comparison

The comparison leverages IriusRisk's version system:

**Architecture Comparison:**
- Parse and compare diagram XML files to identify component, dataflow, and trust zone changes
- Uses IriusRisk's diagram export format

**Security Comparison:**
- Compare threats and countermeasures JSON files
- Uses IriusRisk's computed threat model (not just architecture)

**Key Benefits:**
- **Ephemeral:** Fresh baseline download each run, no stale data
- **Comprehensive:** Compares both architecture AND security implications
- **Safe:** Isolated workspace, never touches main files
- **Accurate:** Uses IriusRisk's threat computation engine
- **One project per app:** Maintains customer paradigm (no temporary projects)

### New MCP Tool: `ci_cd_verification`

**Purpose:** Guide AI agents through the drift detection workflow

**Workflow:**
1. Download baseline from IriusRisk version to baseline-* files
2. Generate OTM from current codebase
3. Import OTM to IriusRisk project (triggers threat computation)
4. Download current state to verification-* files (diagram XML, threats, countermeasures)
5. Compare baseline vs current:
   - Architecture: components, dataflows, trust zones
   - Security: threats, countermeasures
6. Restore IriusRisk project to baseline version
7. Cleanup all temporary files (baseline-* and verification-*)
8. Return comprehensive diff for AI interpretation

**AI Usage:**
- Analyze codebase to generate current OTM
- Interpret architectural changes (new components, dataflows)
- Interpret security changes (new threats, removed countermeasures)
- Assess relationship between architecture and security changes
- Generate report with context and recommendations

### New MCP Prompt: `ci_cd_verification.md`

**Purpose:** Guide AI on security drift analysis in CI/CD context

**Content:**
- When to use this workflow (PR reviews, deployments, audits)
- Step-by-step verification process
- How to interpret different change types
- Decision criteria for pass/warn/block recommendations
- Report formatting guidance for security teams

### 🔒 Security Impact

#### New Threats (8 total)

**HIGH Severity (3):**
- **Unencrypted data in transit to Redis**
  - Component: Redis Cache
  - Related to: Dataflow User Service → Redis
  - Mitigation status: ❌ Not implemented
  - Recommendation: Enable TLS for Redis connections
  
- **Third-party data exposure via Stripe**
  - Component: Stripe Payment API
  - Related to: Dataflow Payment Service → Stripe
  - Mitigation status: ⚠️ Partial (HTTPS, but need PCI compliance verification)
  - Recommendation: Verify Stripe PCI-DSS compliance documentation

- **Session token theft**
  - Component: Redis Cache
  - Related to: Session data stored externally
  - Mitigation status: ❌ Not implemented
  - Recommendation: Encrypt session data before caching

**MEDIUM Severity (5):**
- Cache poisoning attacks (Redis Cache)
- Denial of service via cache (Redis Cache)
- Payment data interception (Stripe API - mitigated by HTTPS)
- ... (3 more)

#### Countermeasures Added (5 total)
- HTTPS for Stripe communication (✅ Implemented)
- Rate limiting via Redis (⚠️ Recommended)
- Cache key validation (⚠️ Recommended)
- Payment data encryption (⚠️ Recommended)
- API key rotation (⚠️ Recommended)

#### ⚠️ Countermeasures Removed (1 total)

**CRITICAL - Security Regression:**
- **Authentication token expiration** (Component: User Service)
  - Previous state: ✅ Implemented (15 minute timeout)
  - Current state: ❌ Removed
  - **Impact:** Tokens never expire, increasing risk of unauthorized access
  - **Action Required:** Explain why this was removed or restore immediately

---

### 🎯 Recommendations

#### Critical (Must Address Before Merge)
1. **Restore authentication token expiration** - Security regression detected
2. **Explain session storage security model** - How are session tokens protected in Redis?
3. **Enable TLS for Redis** - Unencrypted connection crosses trust boundary

#### High Priority (Address Before Production)
4. **Verify Stripe PCI-DSS compliance** - Document compliance status
5. **Encrypt sensitive data in cache** - Session tokens should be encrypted at rest
6. **Implement cache key validation** - Prevent cache poisoning attacks

#### Documentation Needed
7. Update security runbook with Redis operations
8. Document Stripe integration security controls
9. Update data flow diagrams
10. Add Redis to disaster recovery plan

---

### 📊 Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM-HIGH**

This PR introduces two external dependencies (Redis, Stripe) that cross trust boundaries and handle sensitive data. While some security controls are in place (HTTPS for Stripe), several critical gaps exist:

1. The removal of token expiration is a **security regression** that must be explained
2. Redis communication lacks encryption despite crossing trust boundaries
3. PCI-DSS compliance for Stripe needs verification

**Recommendation:** Request changes before approval. Security team review required.

## Baseline Management Strategy

### Baseline Storage Location
Baseline files are temporary working storage in `.iriusrisk/verification/` directory:
```
.iriusrisk/verification/
├── baseline-diagram.xml           # Downloaded from IriusRisk version (temp)
├── baseline-threats.json          # Downloaded from IriusRisk version (temp)
└── baseline-countermeasures.json  # Downloaded from IriusRisk version (temp)
```

### Initial Baseline Setup
1. Security team reviews and approves threat model in IriusRisk
2. Create version snapshot in IriusRisk:
   ```bash
   iriusrisk versions create --name "v2.1-approved" \
     --description "Approved baseline for production - 2024-01-12"
   ```
3. Configure CI/CD to reference this version ID as the approved baseline

### Baseline Update Process
When architectural changes are approved:
1. Security team reviews changes in IriusRisk
2. If approved, create new version snapshot:
   ```bash
   iriusrisk versions create --name "v2.2-approved" \
     --description "Approved Redis integration - 2024-02-15"
   ```
3. Update CI/CD configuration to reference new baseline version

### Version Naming Convention
- **Approved baselines:** `v2.1-approved`, `v2.2-approved`
- **Date-based:** `baseline-2024-01-12`, `baseline-2024-02-15`
- **Release-based:** `baseline-v1.0.0`, `baseline-v2.0.0`
- **Environment-specific:** `baseline-production`, `baseline-staging`

## Open Questions

1. **Frequency:**
   - Run on every PR? (Recommended for security-critical apps)
   - Only on deployment? (Minimum viable)
   - Periodic audits? (Weekly/monthly drift checks)
   - Configurable per-team? (Let teams decide)

2. **Concurrency:**
   - Multiple PRs running verification against same project will conflict
   - Need project locking mechanism?
   - Or: Queue verification jobs?
   - Or: Accept serial execution for MVP?

3. **Scope:**
   - Compare full project or just changed services?
   - For monorepos, per-service or whole repo?
   - How to handle microservices architectures?

4. **Performance:**
   - Full threat model generation can be slow (30-90 seconds)
   - Baseline download adds 2-5 seconds per run
   - Can we do incremental analysis? (Future enhancement)

5. **False Positives:**
   - What if AI incorrectly flags benign changes?
   - How to suppress known-safe patterns? (Future: whitelist)
   - Feedback mechanism for AI improvement?

6. **Workspace Isolation:**
   - `.iriusrisk/verification/` keeps things clean
   - All files are temporary (downloaded and deleted each run)
   - No Git strategy needed

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

## Directory Structure

### `.iriusrisk/verification/` Workspace

All CI/CD verification files are isolated in a dedicated directory:

```
.iriusrisk/
├── project.json                    # existing - project metadata
├── threats.json                    # existing - working copy for normal ops
├── countermeasures.json            # existing - working copy for normal ops
├── updates.json                    # existing - tracked changes
│
└── verification/                   # CI/CD verification workspace (temporary)
    ├── baseline-diagram.xml        # baseline architecture (temp, from IriusRisk version)
    ├── baseline-threats.json       # baseline threats (temp, from IriusRisk version)
    ├── baseline-countermeasures.json  # (temp, from IriusRisk version)
    │
    ├── verification-diagram.xml    # current architecture from PR (temp)
    ├── verification-threats.json   # current threats from PR (temp)
    ├── verification-countermeasures.json  # (temp)
    └── diff-results.json           # comparison output (optional, temp)
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Isolation:** Verification never touches main threats.json/countermeasures.json
- **Ephemeral:** ALL files in verification/ are temporary (created and deleted each run)
- **Fresh data:** Baseline downloaded from IriusRisk version every run
- **Safety:** Context manager ensures cleanup even on failure

## Technical Notes

### File Formats

**Diagram XML:**
- IriusRisk's diagram export format
- Contains components, dataflows, trust zones
- Represents architecture/design

**Threats JSON:**
- IriusRisk's threat export format
- Computed by IriusRisk rules engine
- Each threat has: id, referenceId, name, description, riskRating, state, etc.

**Countermeasures JSON:**
- IriusRisk's countermeasure export format
- Security controls/mitigations
- Each countermeasure has: id, referenceId, name, description, state, implementationStatus, etc.

### Comparison Algorithm

**Architecture Comparison (XML):**
- Parse baseline-diagram.xml and verification-diagram.xml
- Extract components, dataflows, trust zones
- Match by ID or referenceId
- Identify: added, removed, modified (property changes)

**Security Comparison (JSON):**
- Parse threat/countermeasure JSON files
- Match by id or referenceId
- Identify: added, removed, modified
- Detect critical changes: countermeasures removed, threat severity increased

### Matching Strategy
- Primary key: `id` field (UUID)
- Fallback: `referenceId` field (human-readable)
- For dataflows: Match by source+destination+data type

### Why Not Use IriusRisk Version Comparison API?
IriusRisk provides a version comparison API endpoint, but testing revealed reliability issues that make it unsuitable for CI/CD workflows. Our approach uses IriusRisk for threat computation (its core value) but performs comparison locally for reliability.

### Performance Considerations
- Download baseline from IriusRisk version (3 files): 2-5 seconds
- IriusRisk OTM import + threat computation: 10-30 seconds
- Download current state (3 files): 2-5 seconds
- Comparison logic: < 1 second for typical projects
- AI interpretation time: Variable (30-60 seconds typical)
- **Total CI/CD overhead: ~45-95 seconds**

## Edge Cases & Limitations

### Concurrent PR Checks
**Problem:** Multiple PRs running verification against same IriusRisk project will conflict (each updates and restores the project).

**Solutions:**
- **MVP Approach:** Document that verification jobs must run serially
- **Future:** Implement project locking mechanism
- **Future:** Queue verification jobs
- **Alternative:** Use separate IriusRisk projects per environment (prod-baseline, staging-baseline)

### Restore Failure
**Problem:** If project restore fails, IriusRisk project is left in modified state.

**Mitigation:**
- Robust error handling with logging
- Alert security team if restore fails
- Document manual restore procedure
- Consider version snapshots before verification

### Cleanup on Abort
**Problem:** If CI/CD job is cancelled mid-verification, temporary files may remain.

**Mitigation:**
- Context manager ensures cleanup in finally block
- Next run detects and cleans stale files from `.iriusrisk/verification/`
- Document manual cleanup procedure

## Risk & Mitigation

**Risk:** AI misinterprets changes, causes alert fatigue  
**Mitigation:** Provide clear guidance prompts, iterate based on feedback

**Risk:** Performance too slow for CI/CD  
**Mitigation:** Total time ~45-95 seconds is acceptable for security-critical checks

**Risk:** Customers don't understand how to set baselines  
**Mitigation:** Clear documentation, video tutorials, examples showing version creation and configuration

**Risk:** False sense of security if not reviewed  
**Mitigation:** Emphasize "visibility not enforcement" in docs, require human review step

**Risk:** Concurrent PR checks corrupt IriusRisk project  
**Mitigation:** Document serial execution requirement for MVP; add locking in future

## Notes

- This is **visibility tooling**, not a security gate
- Humans make all accept/reject decisions
- Focus on making security team's job easier
- Leverage IriusRisk's existing computation power
- AI's value is in interpretation and communication
